Project Name: The Heist

Project Description:
Our project focuses on solving the case of a murder that occurred during a heist. The user steps into the shoes of Detective Jameson, and listens to recordings of three interrogations they had conducted with the apprehended suspects. We tried to focus on making the experience interactive, and allowing the user plenty of freedom while they try to piece things together. In line with its inspiration from "In a Grove"/Rashomon, we wanted to leave the story open-ended, and perhaps create a chance for users to discuss and debate their perspectives.

Process:
We chose to represent the audio files through physical tapes on the screen and have the user interact with them through a tape recorder/player, which helps get the user settle into the character of a detective. It also adds more weight to each interaction, and to continue that we implemented a drag-and-drop for the user to submit their final answer. There were also some other choices, like interrupting the user at the beginning and end to try and guide their experience, and giving some degree of feedback with the ending screen and example results to try and make the open-ended nature feel contemplative instead of unsatisfying.


Reflection/Evaluation:
Overall, the final product met most of our goals and feels like a success. We were able to go from conceptualiazation to realization while including almost all of our initial ideas, as well as introducing new ones as the experience came together and we saw chances to include little bits to improve the immersion. One thing that went differently from planned was that we initially intended to have an introductory audio to explain the setting, but the project instructions led us to believe that we needed to give a presentation prior to showing our product instead.
